Networking & Communication
======================================

Your Luck Surface Area is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you're passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.

Network/Relationships

* Your brand
* Employability
* Career Management
* Revenue Streams
* Continuing Education
* Relationship capital

The best networkers are listeners rather than talkers, have a clear agenda, and are not shy about asking for feedback and guidance. 
Remember that networking is more about giving than it is about talking.
Martin Buckland

Give more than take, but ready to receive

Should you be a Power Connector?
Why become a Power Connector

* You provide value to your contacts
* You strengthen your relationship with others
* Your brand solidifies and includes: 'seems to know everyone!'
* You focus more on giving

People with less programming/technical skills but much better communications skills will often be more successful than you.

Stop, think, speak!

Search for Scale
L1: Work: fix bugs, bill by the hour, do as you're told
L2: Lead (Talk about work): Select architectures & technologies, mentor, hire & lead teams, define project scope & process
L3: Own: Product: SAAS, PAAS, framework, author

Communication: Quality over Quantity
Impact of words - 7%
Impact of voice - 38%
Impact of body language - 58%

Be careful of the inconsistent message
Listen with all your senses!
The truth about multitasking - just a fantasy!
